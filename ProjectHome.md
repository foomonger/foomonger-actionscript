The Foomonger ActionScript Package is a collection of utilities I've created to address my regular coding needs.  I tried to only include code that hasn't been created before (or at least not available outside of a heavy framework).

The stars of this package are the [Later](com_foomonger_utils_Later.md) and [LoadWatcher](com_foomonger_utils_LoadWatcher.md) classes.

  * Tired of using a MovieClip's `onEnterFrame` to wait 1 frame?
  * Want a better way trigger animation code?
    * **Check out the [Later](com_foomonger_utils_Later.md) class.**

  * Always finding yourself loading a bunch of files and thinking there must be a better way to track the load progress?
  * Are you trying to load more files than the browser can handle at once and find that your progress bar jumps back and forth?
    * **Check out the [LoadWatcher](com_foomonger_utils_LoadWatcher.md) class.**
